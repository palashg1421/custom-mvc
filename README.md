# PHP MVC App

A basic implementation of **MVC** structure using **core PHP**. The concepts are completely inherited from the most popular **CodeIgniter** framework.

It mimics the same MVC & **Scripting** concept which are used in Codeigniter but at a lower scale. This platform has developed in such a way that one can easily implement it further for any small-scale usage.

It also follows the **PSR** concept including **Autoloading**, **Namespaces** with the help of the **Composer** with a simple **MySQL** database connectivity.
